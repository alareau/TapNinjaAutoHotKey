# TapNinjaAutoHotKey
AutoHotKey script for the game Tap Ninja

I just made some script to make it easier to auto it.

Ctrl+1 will setup the ascension script.  It will auto ascend shortly after the start.
Ctrl+2 will setup the idling script.  It will randomly click on the screen and then try to buy updates.

It will resize your window and center it.  (Too hard to manage the buttons if you had a smaller resolution)
